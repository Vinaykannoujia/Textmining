0,2.0,Not worth buying it.,"I had redmi 6 Pro and exchanged it for Redmi 11.But I'm not impressed with the phone.Display looks normal and I don't think its better than Redmi 6 pro. I still feel Redmi 6 pro screen is best.Camera is really a avg one. Not worth it.Prev Redmi phones were really good, camera quality too will be goodThis one doesn't fit in to Redmi family. Though it has good specifications, it doesn't worth.Fast charger is good, charges really fast.If you just need a phone you can go for this phone... more review after a week.Review after couple of weeks - March 8 2022.Display - Doesnt look like AMOLED display. For me its like a ordinary one.Battery: It charges really fast and it can withstand for a day.Use: I nvr did gaming on this phone. Just using for call & whatsapp. Sometime, screen flashes and some app crashes. Happens atleast once or twice a day. call quality is good. Though I've 6GB RAM, it nvr behaves it has 6GB of RAM.This phone can be used for ppl, who need a phone wiht big display and battery.camera is really bad. Don't know why Redmi is doing like this. Pictures looks normal outside with good sunlight. Under tubelight, could see more noises in picture. Not at all happy with camera."

2,4.0,Good but not great,"Pros- Amoled Screen, Battery easily lasts a day or day n half on moderate usage.Charging Speed, Size of the mobile which is handy can b accessed though single hand..Separate SD card slot.CONS- CAMERA low light pictures are worst...A Big Dissapoinment, Price should have been a 1000 less considering processor, No 5G.."

¬†Hello all,Am new to redmi(note 11), yesterday I received new mobile and please find my observation at below.Am not a gaming user, am moderate user(daily usage) so i preferred Snapdragon 680 chip with 6nm architecture, but in the Redmi note 11 the chip is different Snapdragon 665 with 11 nm architecture.So please be awareness. The issue in company level not Amazon.So Am returning the same mobile.For your reference I have attached screen recorded, please find the same.Note: They have mentioned in the box, mobile(about option) as snapdragon ""680"" But they used 665 chipset instead of 680.Simply waste of money for 15k budget please go for other branding mobile.Thanks."
5,4.0,Redmi Note 11,"Redmi Note 11 is great piece, but automatic call recording option is not proper.Request to Xiaomi Mi for updates that."

¬†A good fone in this price range display,sound, design excellent camara also good .always on display is not available always it is a gimmick after ten second display tun of automaticaly not available always why they saying always an display for this.miui 13 is nothing need more updates also 4 k recording not provided it is a major drawback for a amoled display even note seven pro my old phone have 4k 30 fos. Recording lack of 5 g is not big matter because even 4g is not providing properly by net works so forget 5g it is only for metros no laging or heating issues charging is superb by 33watt hyper charging .very good phone for normal uses I am not a Gamer so iam unable to say about gaming after 10 days use iam satisfied with this phone"
7,2.0,Dissapointed with product,This is not an upgaradation of previous models like Note 9 & Note 10.Only display and Battery is highlight of this phone.Camera performance was very bad and low light performance terrible.The performance of processor is averge.Pricing of this phone should be 10k
8,1.0,Worst phone ever 16k no 4k video recording worst camera,Worst phone ever in16k no 4k video recording worst camera. Note 10 have best camera and have 4k video recording and much better than note 11 dont buy this phone
9,4.0,"Good display and body , worst camera","Really good device with great looks and screen. camera is quality is really bad, do not trust online reviews. Can't game on this.Buy for light use and older generation people."
10,1.0,Dont Buy serious wifi issue with this note 11,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†wifi is not detecting and automatic wifi connection is also not working"
11,1.0,"Important features removed, battery and display is very good","Friends, there is no call recording features in mi, redmi and poco phones i think, i don't know others, i think one plus and samsung are build with call recording please confirm before buying, display, battery and speed is very very good at this price range, camera is poor, design is good, MIUI 13 out of the box is good, worst google dialer, contact and message is great great disadvantages"
12,4.0,Good for daily tasks,"Bought this phone since my old phone was giving me network related troubles and also the processor was not powerful enough to handle latest apps. This phone is excellent to do regular tasks like social media apps, browsing, youtube, online study etc. Processor is capable enough to handle normal tasks related to our day to day affairs.It has UFS 2.2 storage feature which makes app opening snappier. Initially I wanted to go with Moto G31 but this phone easily beats G31 in value for money department. My only concern with this phone was the ads/crapware in MiUi but surprisingly Xiaomi has manage to reduce it a lot and if you carefully disable the relevant options within the MiUi, you will not get any ads.Regarding Camera, it has average camera quality. Nothing impressive but this was expected in the price range and I'm ok with it cause I'm not a selfie shooter. I have my own DSLR which I use for any special kind of photography. Video is not that great. Its OK for one time viewing or for sharing on social media.Processor is OK. It can handle most regular daily tasks without any issues. Occasional hiccups are expected but they are understandable in terms of price-performance ratio. What surprised me is that my Mom's Redmi Note 5 has Snapdragon 625 processor which has 4K video recording but this one doesn't despite it being superior to 625 processor. It would be great if Xiaomi can enable at least 1080p/60fps in the next update.Phone has all the important sensors like gyroscope, compass etc. Many times in this prices range, gyro or compass sensor is absent which are important sensors. I use Google maps a lot for navigation so Compass comes handy to know my direction.Screen is excellent. Its on Par with 20-25K phone range. 90hz is smooth. Sunlight visibility in outdoor is great. My old phone had IPS panel which was excellent but sunlight visibility was very poor. This is just brilliant. Content watching is immersive. Also its not too big either like 6.7 inches phone which are cumbersome to carry in pants. This one is sleek looking.Battery is above average tbh. Xiaomi needs to do better optimization in this phone. Though it has 5000mah battery but optimization is poor which eats away battery even while doing normal tasks. It can survive the whole day but Xiaomi needs to think about it in the battery department. 33w fast charger is game changer. It charges phone fairly quickly. So, that balances out the optimization issue to a bit. Kudos to Xiaomi for providing ""real fast charger"" instead of supplying 15w charger and calling it ""Fast charger"".Water/Dust resistance is essential.It has Dedicated slot for SD card which is also a plus point which going for this phone. Other phones in this category have hybrid solutions or no expansion slot.Side Mounted physical fingerprint sensor works great. This is what I prefer instead of in-display optical finger print scanners.Carrier Aggregation is there. Dual 4G standby works great. I can use Vodafone 4G while JIO sim stays active. Call quality is great. Dual Speakers provide adequate loudness and speaker quality are excellent.Overall this phone serves my needs. You can weigh your requirements with pros/cons and decide it. There won't be a perfect phone in this price range but this one ticked all my requirements. Thank you Xiaomi. You sure know how to make affordable and value for money smartphones for Indian consumers."
13,5.0,Awesome Amoled & battery backup.Best for multimedia consumption.,I was using redmi note 5 and now upgraded to this phone.It's AMOLED display is awesomeüòçüòçüòç. Its the best thing in this phone.. And also good battery backup. 20-24 hrs with moderate use..Starburst white colour is superbüòçüòçüòç. I loved it.Decent Rear camera U will love it.Front camera is ok better than redmi note 5 but not compare this with 20k or 30k phone cameras. Video quality is average.At this price it is good.Good performance. No lag issues. 90Hz refresh rate is nice. Finger print sensor is working fine.Bright Torch light. Light weight.. Easy to use in one hand.. Comfortable design. First  day I experience a delay in charging and I thought it doesn't have fast charging at all. And also there was huge heat issue during charging.Second day that problem is almost solved.. Heating problem reduced and charging also become faster.. And  4th day onwards normal heat issue only and charging become faster.Auto call recording is not there.
14,1.0,Redmi Note 11 review :: Camera Quality is not upto the Mark.,"Advantages::* UI Display looks good.Disadvantages::* Mainly camera/video quality is not satisfied. company informed 50MP.. but pixel clarity less than 16MP.. The reason is 50MP is not default in camera view.  everytime, we have to select 50MP option.. Also no zoom option for 50MP view.. Completely unworthy cameras compare to samsung/Realme(sony camera).* When Playing game also phone got hanged frequently...* Morning you charged in , end of the day is getting completely drained..* 2 speakers sounds are little lower than other phones..* Too many advertisements.. its keep on advertising on every navigations..so, its budget phones.. targetting all middle peoples with Ads. so MI company will get more beneficial from you,. AND YOU WILL NOT BE GETTING BENEFICIAL., YOU WILL BE SEEING SO MANY ADS LIKE YOUTUBE,.Before buying, Think twice.. if you need Good quality camera/video phones, just Blindly go for Other brands like Samsung/Realme & lQOO..If you don't bother camera quality, focusing on good display & surfing YouTube & browser, you can opt this.."
15,4.0,Decent phone but not for heavy gaming,"Though writing a review only using it for 4 days is too early, but there are few things need to be shared:Display: Excellent Display. Build quality is also good.Battery & Charging: Good battery life (24 to 36 hrs in moderate usage) & fast charging.Audio: Decent audio quality with dual speakersCamera: Good camera in daylight conditions, images are sharp & detailed... though under low light it's a bit grainy but still detailed (again other mobiles in this range also has similar problems, their softwares in order to lose the grains makes the picture soft)Video: Video is not upto the mark. It's very shaky. Must have some issues with the stabilizer.Gaming: Gaming with high graphics & for long hours is not recommended. Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 is not a heavy gaming processor(However I was playing SFA for 2-3 hours with low graphics quality & its performing fine)Heating: Till date no heating issues."
16,1.0,Worst Camera,Photos are similar as captured with old phone's VGA camera. Camera quality is pathetic. Don't buy. There is no return and refund option. Horrible experience
17,2.0,Below Average,Selfie is not good quality. Do not like the camera much. Auto pics taken are not good. Battery drains even if not in use.
18,1.0,Poor Camera,Camera is not up to the mark....There is noise in the pictures taken in night time...Don't go for it...i feel cheated...
19,3.0,Average phone with bad camera,Redmi phones quality is going down with each updated model. E.g. my Note 8 has much better camera quality than my new Note 11.Further the speakers at full volume may permanently damage them (again low quality).Perhaps this is going to be my last Redmi product as I will switch to a better quality brand after 3 years (once Redmi permanently makes my phone non operational through software upgrades as it happened in two previous phones 3S Prime and Note 7).
20,5.0,"Battery, light weight, Slim, handy, camera, speaker over all","The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†The phone is so attractive & slim Sreen resolution is 90Ghz which is quite good its has dual speaker with side finger print, light weight, camera is not so good if you want to buy this for photography this phone is not for you but the over all performance is so good at this price, money worthy."
21,5.0,Awesome,Hi after so confusion I have ordered the beast.... I was about to go for I qooo z5 or vivo t1 but those are not super amoled display.... This is very gud with decent specs.... Fast charging within 1 hour.... Decent camera... Performance then what else....... Happy with redmi note 11...
22,1.0,Very Disappointed,"Just don't buy it.I will update my review if any changes are observed in future.Comparing this to my 2 years old realme x2Pros - The only pro is dual speakersCons:-1. Build is inferior to realme x2.2. YouTube only supports 1080 while my earlier device supported 2160.3. Audio codec support on bluetooth ji device is SBC while my previous device supported AAC.4. Earpiece audio quality is not good too.5. Camera quality in front as well as back is not as good as my previous device.It felt like a downgrade from my previous device which had the same price and better processorI was hoping it to be having a good build like Redmi note 10 unfortunately it doesn't, currently very disappointed from Mi.There is not a option to return this product, only damaged products can be returned so I am stuck with it. Amazon should show a pop up regarding such important matters and should not hide it in some corner.Was a satisfied prime user until now but now I am questioning my choices."
23,2.0,"Having Performance issue, feels like using old phone","The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Pro: Phone having 33w fast charger this is the best one only.Cons: Performance issue, app crash, no cache memory working everytime app restart when access from opened multiple apps.No call recording, fingerprint shutter missing.Very slow response.Not worthy to buy, you all can go for pro series.This is really very disappointed already used redmi not 3 and 8 previously so purchased this one.Already raised request to refund, waste of time money and effort."
24,4.0,"Good sound, display, Super fast charching","Phone was nice üëç light weight one hand use size, loud speakers ,display super, fast charching"
25,2.0,Suffers from serious CPU throttling issues!~,"Performance gets sluggish after taking calls(normal call, whatsapp call) due to CPU throttling.I have even observed CPU frequency getting stuck at 690Mhz and never coming up (Enable Developer options -> Power monitor -> Monitor Frame rate)This is a SERIOUS bug and root cause of all performance issues being faced by multiple users of RedmiNote11. In fact I am reviewing my 2nd unit after exchanging 1st unit due to performance issues.Check the attached pic how Geekbench scores vary based on which time benchmark was taken.Before the call, all good scores above 380. Post taking calls, it become 170!"
26,5.0,Redme note 11,"Good product from Xiaomi with the latest features, value for money. Both camera quality is excellent."
27,1.0,Worst phone from Redmi and worst services from amazon,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I purchased this phone from  Amazon and from 5th day onwards the screens goes blank, most of the times I make a call. The phone lags a lot when compared to another phones of same spec. On contacting customer services, they say I need to send phone back to seller via courier and post that they will refund the amount. Now, I have to wait for another 2-3 days without phone until another phone is delivered."
28,5.0,DECENT MOBILE,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†MY HONEST REVIEW :-LOOKING -> 10PERFORMANCE -> 9DISPLAY -> 8CAMERA -> 7 [ REAR ] - 6 [ SELFIE ]BATTERY -> 9CHARGING -> 10SOUND -> 10DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH FOR THIS PRICE RANGE , IT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH AT THIS PRICE POINT - OVERALL BEST MOBILE WITH GOOD FEATURES"
29,1.0,Don't buy this buggy and pathetic phone. I am regretting,1. Even Redmi note 7 has 1000 time better camera optimization than this. 50MP yet images are pathetic and when you try to see images they takes time to load. Even my older phone with 20MP takes better details than this 50MP.2. Even my older phone with far less antutu score than this has better performance. This phone is not optimised. Shows lags and can't retair app memory as many times to switch to other app and when you come back it restarts that app even my older phone is better than this.3. Charging is good but battery backup is average.I will suggest you to go for realme as I am highly disappointed by buying this phone.
30,3.0,"horrible camera don't buy if camera is important, Privacy Issue  & many more Problems in UI","1. You can't enable an Always-on display for the whole time. It will be shown only after 10 sec you turn off the screen2. Notification Sound setting is not available I can't believe you can't turn off notification sound separately in 2022 this feature is available in 2015 smartphones it is combined with ringtone sound you have to silent your whole phone If You don't want notification sound definitely Then you are going to miss the calls then because vibration is not strong during ringing but in other cases typing taping vibration fell very strong3. Focus mode is a joke In this phone you will still get notification from focus mode itself if someone Texted you on WhatsApp or any other app send you a notification it will not show from which app it's coming but it's still annoying What the point of focus mode if I am getting notification from focus mode itself4. BIG PRIVACY ISSUE - there is an app called security app I don't know why smartphones need this kind of app in 2022 what's the point of a smartphone anyway this app takes your all permission all means all location, camera, call logs, file & storage everything but you can't disable it and can't uninstall it"
31,1.0,Defective piece is received,"I ordered the product on 25 Feb and it received me today, but when I open this and start the phone I found the screen is yellowish in color which fades a lot.And I have also post a photo which clearly seen the difference in the screen color.Very disappoint with this"
32,5.0,Must have,"I purchased it for my father. It's great, working smoothly and what else would we need. I mean it's a normal phone with better display and carrier aggregation. However, let's not set the expectations so high. If you are buying the phone for camera, you can go for high end Samsung, Apple or even OnePlus device that will cost you 40k + for a decent phone from those companies. But buying this phone and complaining that camera is not on par with DSLR is something hilarious. For my father, it's a great phone. Display is the primary highlight."

35,4.0,Very good phone for normal users.,"RN 11 is a good phone at 12499, the display is superb. Battery backup is very good thanks to 6nm processor. The speakers are clear and loud.The biggest letdown were cameras, the sensor produces average pics in daylight. It doesn't support 60fps , or EIS . Also the device doesn't feel snappy, it stutters while switching to apps .Conclusion - Good phone if you are content consumer , don't even consider this if camera & gaming are your 1st priorities."

¬†Received this phone with scratch on screen. May be it is manufacturing defect. After raising replacement request they have assigned mobile inspection service and the the provider did not meet the appointment date and time. He is not even picking up my call.After replacement still there are lot of issues are there in this phone. Camera app is not working properly even quality is not good grains are coming after photo captured.It is waste of time again and again I have to call customer service. It is not pathetic."
37,1.0,Worst Phone ever. üòû,"Bought this phone at 16k and wasted my Money.1. Camera:Front camera is worst camera ever in any phone under even 10k  13MP Camera looks like 1.3MP VGA camera that comes in 1k Feature Chinese phones while video calls even if you use Fiber 100mbps or 1gbps connection.Back camera is 50MP but in Indoor it's like old 5MP in Only work good in Sunlight and outdoor good lighting conditions otherwise don't expect much it's badest 50MP camera.Max resolution for video recording is only 1080p 30fps ..... old Realme 6 can record 1080p 60fps 4k 30fps  and compare the price of both. This Redmi Note 11 Even doesn't support 1080p 60fps Only 30fps is max option in this why it have an new processor if old one is powerful. This phone is completely Downgrade on any phone you currently have right now. Even from 2017 ....2. Performance:  As per the specs on paper it mentioned SD 680 in it and it's poor processor and even MediaTek G85 works better than this shit.It take longer time to capture and preview picture in galley after we take a photo in camera. And phone even didn't support Some apps properly Like vidmate kinemaster and few other apps it just automatically close apps after sometime while using and kinemaster just open only 1st time 2nd it start crashing and that was not app issue it's phone issue itself.3. Software:  Only one thing i want to say is Now i figured out why it called a MeMe Ui ........Lags a lot. Hangs like 10 years old phone.4. Display: Yeah Good but 60hz looks like 30hz and 90hz looks like 60hz so No reason to spend Money for 90hz screen .....  Buy any other good phone with 60hz it will be lot better than this 90hz .....5. Battery:I haven't used phone much because of these issues so i wanted to Return and Get Refund buy amazon Rejected .....  Battery maybe a good in this phone but for how ""long""So, My opinion on this phone is if you get it under 10k than ok but if you you can use it  with those issues i have mentined above otherwise not worth to buy...""Say No To This Phone"" Don't waste Your Money on This Device it will not work properly. And can't satisfy and Normal User.For camera Users Don't buy it .... If you use camera in Low Light conditions than Don't waste your money on this phone better to buy Any other phone but not This.Do Not Buy this üëé"

¬†I'm using this phone for about 1 month as my daily driver,i found the ‚ö†Ô∏èDISPLAY BLINKING while using applications, i don't know if it was a hardware issue,The retrun policy has ended.there was screen flickering issues with AMOLED screens on the NOTE 10 SERIES,charging time increased from 1 hour to 1 and half hour after update,also phone gets slower,1080p 30 fps video gets stuttering,so many bugs,please ask note 11 user if they have any issues before buying the phone"
39,4.0,Not much better than note 10 last year.,It is an average performance device and at some part it performs below average.Pros:-Dual speakers.-90 hz Amoled display-50mp camera- miui 13 (android 11) out of the box.- 1gb more memory extension in 4gb ram device- quite light phone.- battery Is best.Cons :- Processor : it makes the phone perform similar to redmi cheaper ‚Çπ7000-‚Çπ9000 phones.- Display : Avg quality amoled display although the brightness is very good it does not feel as crisp as my note 10 pro also you can't play HDR videos on it and no 4k video support.- Audio : no Dolby Atmos support and those who use note 10 pro knows how much it affects the sound (i.e. takes it from avg to good quality loudspeaker experience)- Camera : it says 50mp and shots do come out quite good but that is during sufficient lighting only and image quality takes a huge toll in slightly poor lighting conditions.I bought it for my mother and for her the YouTube Facebook and Instagram work fine audio is sufficiently loud.Also remember to buy the insurance at least for screen damage as it is amoled display and could cost you high during repairs.
40,4.0,Best value for money product.,REVIEW AFTER 1 WEEK :Battery life - battery life and the fast charging is  Impressivescreen/ display- smooth (90hz) display.... Amoled screen is also very good üëç.... Dayligjt visibility is clearSpeaker - speakers are really nice and the audio quality is clear and loudCamera - camera department is very average nothing extraordinary... But i installed GCAM and the results are much better.... But the night camera seriously needs work its very dull...... Even the selfie camera is not as good.Perfomance - perfomance is decent ... But yes few time it does jittersFINAL VERDICT - as of feb 2022 this is the best phone at this price segment ( rs.13499 )The above pic is shot using this phone but via GCAM
41,4.0,Overall performer with some drawbacks,"The 6Gb Ram version is quick and works well on daily tasks, Ram management is good, the only flaws I saw is a boatload of junk per installed in the phone and Wi-Fi seems to be a bit weak as it keeps disconnecting frequently on moving around. But works well on 2.4 ghz. I Bought this for my mother and it works pretty well and 90hz screen refresh rate is also amazing,auto brightness although does not work really well specifically in dark mode the brightness becomes too low.Update: Wi-Fi issue Still Persists even after changing all the suggested option."
42,1.0,Fooled with camera,The camera is very bad. Its not an upgrade. It feels like camera is not even 10 MegaPixel. Such a poor camera. Cheaper phones have better camera.

44,1.0,Very Bad Camera Quality Don't Buy It,Camera quality is very poor don't buy this phone.  The camera quality of the phone that comes in thousand rupees is very time wast and money waste.
45,2.0,Don't buy if you're looking for a good smartphone,"Not that great! Fingerprint sensor on the right side of the phone is the biggest disappointment out of all! Just a light touch will open it plus the location of the sensor is the most common place to touch. Secondly, the notifications are completely useless I can never pickup a call on time because it keeps on disappearing whenever I try to click, same goes for reminders and alarms. Also, the back of the phone gets easily scratched. If you're buying it on budget then it's okay but if you want a good smartphone with great technology this phone is not it!"
46,1.0,Camera quality is not as per 50MP.,Camera quality is not as per 50MP.
47,1.0,Don't buy this phone and any product from Amazon..,Don't buy this phone.. replacement and refund Options are not available.. product is too worst.. camera quality is not Good. Even amazon knows about this product that's why they don't want to get this product back from customer. This will be my last purchase with amazon.. Indians should not support this foreign company.. Earning from us.. incase of replacement they will ask us to read policy. Bye amazon..
48,4.0,MI has designed it the way it'd help business works get done smoothly,"The phone is good (I've 6+64 Black one). MI has increased the power efficiency, display quality, and camera from the older version keeping in mind the way it'd do wonders for business work although as expected the processor is on a downside.It'd have been awesome if a glass back was there and sd695 would've been fitted but 14.5k is a fair price for the released product no doubt but upgrading it from RN4 was a big loss for me personally.Issues:1. The left speaker (on the top) is producing a lower sound as compared to the right one (below). Balancing it in the setting would do the job but please update it in the next software upgrade.2. GPS location is not getting accurate. It's about 200m-1000m inaccurate. (Thinking about replacing it)."
49,4.0,Great value for money,"This is a good phone at 13k and better than Samsung phones under 20k.Camera is quite good. The uwa camera is 8 mp which is decent. Added photos of uwa,wa and 2x zoom. Clearly better than previous Samsung M21 I had. And does not kill the images by oversharpening like Samsung did.Pro mode allows full control. camera2api fully supported (level 3). Overall 5/5 for cam.Calling and network seems ok. SAR 0.85 which is better than many other phonesAudio 5/5 - has stereo speakers with some bass and quite loud, 3.5mm jack and sound through headphones is excellent.Battery lasts more than 2 days for me as I only do calls, use camera sometimes and listen to music. The 5000 mah battery somehow lasts longer than the 6000 one in Samsung.Comes with all sensors and fm radio.MIUI 13 - liking it so far. Coming from one ui 3.1 and stock Android before that, my opinion is that they were clean and simple but lack some useful features. MIUI is more customizable and useful.No heating or lagging issues so far but I dont play games, so cant comment on that.Overall complete package with 33w charger and back silicon case screen protector, unlike recent Samsung phones which removed charger and put a usb c to usb c cable so that some people are still forced to buy chargers.Also no 5G which is good for price reduction. By the time 5G gets available properly the prices will reduce."
50,1.0,Worst Audio in Bluetooth  and Buggy OS,"Dear All, I would say, stay away from this phone, asThis phone freezes in between and takes around 20-30 minutes to be normal,I was using Samsung F12 which really have weak processor and slow but never ever freezes.Top of this the bluetooth audio quality is worst, my bluetooths1- realme buds wireless 2 neo and2 - realme buds wireless proare useless now, though it gives good audio on my realme wired earbuds but very low sound on my bluetooth earbudsCamera quality is utterly DisappointingI am feeling cheated"
51,1.0,Most slow phone by redmi ever.......Don't Buy......,* I am writing review after 3 months of usage...* It's take almost more than 3 hours to charge from 0 to 100%.* It gets hanged and lagged during Instagram reels.* In dark mode the screen gets black lining from right side of screen in most of the the apps.* I also share the screenshot of the above problem in dark mode.* Battery üîã is okk but charging is too slow not charge even at 5 watt from 33 watt pro charger.* If anyone have same problem mentioned above with his or her phone please review to Amazon and mi so they fix this problem in upcoming update mostly the charging problem.
52,3.0,"Good Display, Average Phone","A moderately priced mid range phone with Amoled display which is probably it's USP.Performance is okay for light users, definitely not suitable for gamers or heavy users.Camera is poor, at par with phones under 10k.Android 11 from the box, haven't received update so far. Hoping to get atleast 2 major updates in the near future.Charging time more than an hour but that's acceptable for the price range and battery size.Will recommend this phone to users who like Amoled display and smooth operation, if camera and gaming/high performance is your priority than this phone is not the best in the range."
53,1.0,The most 3rd clasasentation etc only phone was there inside the box.,"I have not received charger, warranty card and this set is worst it has tremendous network issue. U cannot hear anything call drop type. Camera is also worst. Already demanded for replacement let's see. Friends pls don't buy this phone."
54,4.0,Compromise with love of MI,"As most of review..Pros. - Amoled Screen, 6 gb ram in less price.Battery backup & fast charge, Stereo speakers.Cons. - Camera Quality, processing,Overall okay purchase, you may buy it. üëç"
55,2.0,A product which gave issues rather than features,"The first week usage was quite normal and there was not a single hint of problems. But with time, I started to notice some bugs which I thought was caused by software issues and could be fixed through an minor update. As days passed the issues got bad such as Delayed call notification,disappearance of call logs,and worst of all sudden blinking of display (""On-Off issue"") that stays for 15-20 minutes whenever happens.Even the quality of the camera doesn't stand upto the mark as the videos I capture seems to contain lots of noise and grains. Also the Ram management and the refresh rate is not quite perfect, it looks like the features were just part of the overhyped marketing and was not actually put in the device as I use it in my everyday life. Therefore I am really disappointed with this device performance and totally irritated by the issues that keeps accelerating as time passes."
56,1.0,Loose Type-C port like used smartphone,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Type - C Port is very loose and cable vertical moment kr rha hai"
57,3.0,Poor Camera Quality.,"Disappointed with Camera, is not as good as it should be. It is Not 5G phone. At this price redmi should give 5G. Not much happy with this. Redmi Note 8 Pro and Note 10 Pro is much better than redmi Note 11. Go with redmi Note 8 Pro Or 10 Pro."

59,1.0,5 mega pixel camera quality from 50 mega pixel camera,Worst camera quality compared to any other phone in this price range. Have lot of scope to improve camera performance via update
60,4.0,Budget phone,"To be specific... A very good budget phone for regular use...Pros: 1. Good battery life.... 2. Fast charging... 3. Amoled display... 4. Though not top notch still a fast processor... 5. Miui13 looks refreshing... 6. Phone size is just perfect for handling with one hand.. 7. Stereo speakers at this price range...Cons. 1. No call recording, needs separate app for recording a call which eventually will be irritating coz many apps won't work properly...2. Pretty average camera3. Not much changes in the design in miui 13..4. As low priced, many file types aren't supported5. Average gameplay experience"
61,1.0,Worst ever mobile in my life don't buy it,"There are many obligations facing with my mobile after the use of 15days,Camera quality is worst first thing,doesn't charge at all,it's taking 8hrs to get charging,Now I'm trying to sell it off but no resale value they are asking for 10000.Worst processors,Its hanging up already, with a phone call and doesn't work as my activities, it works as it needs. Keypad is worst not working properly,  please don't buy MI or real me Xiaomi phones in life , I need a replacement but not able to do it, as it has been passed of a month. Really worst mobiles from these bad companies.I'm selling my phone now itself, There is no response from Redmi if i contacted them also , Please consider this , i lost 4000 in a 15days buy buying this worst mobile ever , I think i had a bad luck to get this type of defective piece ."
62,4.0,"For the budget ""OK""",I've been writing this after using for couple of weeksA decent mobile for this budget (6gb /64gb)Im an average user1. Battery - V. Good ( more than a day)2. Looks - Good3. Performance - Fair ( didn't felt much lag other than dialpad) (dialpad will take few seconds to come not that swift)4. Camera - Fair (50 mp - cant agree with that)5. Screen - Good (Amoled - liked)So in short - for this budget this mobile is good.
63,1.0,Total disappointment,A month's review. It is an upgrade from Redmi Note 7 pro 6GB ram.1. Lagging at many places2. Charging led missing3. Fingerprint awkwardly placed as it keeps opening if accidentally touched4. Imp: Many people complaining call voice quality not good even in Airtel. Voice breaking etc. Redmi note 7 pro was good no complaints.5. Shockproof Back covers  only available for pro version it means Resmi note 11 is failure model less people have purchasedNot recommended
64,1.0,Pathetic mobile and worst Amazon service,"First of all I would like to tell all the people here on Amazon that don't buy products from this website.They may give you great discounts on products but if you get the defective products then they do not bother to make your life like a hell.So adding to above, I got delivered the Redmi Note 11 mobile on 14th June and on the same day after checking, I came to know that mobile is having camera issue. I placed return order request but almost 4-5 times every amazon representative said that your mobile is not having any problem. Moreover they asked me to visit Mi service center to further escalate the issue. I did as asked but Mi center replied the same thing as Amazon person said earlier. Now Amazon is saying we cant do anything as Mi service center is denying to replace the mobile.So overall I would like to say that if you get defective mobile, then Amazon and Mi throw the ball to each others court and finally we as a customer burn our fingers. So don't choose this website or Mi products to ruin your happiness."
65,5.0,Very nice mobile as a expected! Thanks Redmi and Amazon,"Mobile is very beautiful as we see in photosgood camera, fast charger, amoled display, alexa experice free and also a good quality back cover free.Thanks redmi for such a nice mobiles as a always use redmi mobiles and also thanks to amazon and ecom for fast devilery."
66,1.0,I don‚Äôt suggest this mobile to anyone !,"The mobile it selfs looks and feel cheap quality.  In 2 months usage I the mobile stopped working. When visited service Center ‚Äú they claimed the battery is dead ‚Äú and need a replacement , can you believe that !!The camera is the worst, you won‚Äôt like the pictures you have taken so don‚Äôt expect to have any memorable pictures from it.But I say though the display is good.Cellular again not that great !So that is over all experience till date."
67,4.0,Good Enough,The best part is Its Amoled screen and Best battery life... Its value for money There is No need To buy a 5g Phone Now. 5g still need to be devloped In India It may take 2 years. I would rather Recommend This Phone Than 11s Because Both have the same Specs Except 5G bands and Camera. If you take Lot of photos and Concerned about Camera. Than This Is not the phone i would recommend. I did not Game in this phone so i would be skipping that.  So over all Value for money i would say.. (after 2 weeks of useage)
68,3.0,Lagging issues and Bluetooth pairing issues,"This review after one month using this mobile note 11...I have issues with wireless connection for Bluetooth and WiFi,hotspot..1. Bluetooth have pairing issues,when I tried to connect with Bluetooth devices it's not connect it's showing error.once I have connect with my Bluetooth headphones in the morning then after two to 3hrs it Will be disconnected automatically then again I had tried to connect but not connected it will taken more and after one hrs will connected the same devices its working but again and again I'm facing the same issues2.have lagging issues some time mobile got hanging, when I watch the YouTube have scrolled the up,down it will hanging..same what's app also..3.

69,4.0,Choose Wisely (Honest Review),"Redmi Note 11 (6Gb Ram & 64 Gb Storage) ‚Çπ14000.{More than 1month of using this device and will continue it as long as I don't have enough money to buy an another phone.}1. This is good in performance for calling, gaming, social media, etc., no disappoint in performance according to device specifications.2. Display is perfect with colors and brightness and refresh rate great with this price range.3. Dual stereo speakers is a delight thing.4. Day long battery which also depends on usage, can drain the battery in 5-6 hrs or maybe 7hrs on continuous use by heavy gaming or binge watching or video calling, I have done it.5. A great DISAPPOINTMENT form camera, both front and rear.6. Fingerprint reader is slow compared to many phones in this range (‚Çπ14000)Overall research hard if you're on budget around ‚Çπ14000 to ‚Çπ15000."
70,3.0,Disappointed,"Review after 10days of usage: I am really disappointed with the camera quality. The primary camera is good under sunlight but the rest are useless.Charging is really fast. The size of the phone makes it easy to grasp. For a person who doesn't play games, the phone is somewhat ok. The phone seems to have a tendency to heat up during video calls."
71,5.0,Excellent value,"As a complete smartphone it's perfect. Feels solid durable. Compact for one hand operation and ultra sensitive touch control. Does everything you need from a cell phone. Its best part is the screen, call it HD or whatever but ages are ultra sharp I'm all modes. Only default that needed adjustment was the auto setting for screen brightness. This I set manually as in auto mode it was too dark.All in all a great buy at a great price."
72,5.0,One of the best phone at this price range. You must look it.,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†It is good. Here are some information about phone after a use of 1 month.Display-10/10,Sound-9/10 because bottom speaker and upper speaker have different volume like 80% down and 20%up.Camera-8/10 in good light conditions it is very good but in low light and in house camera is average.Performance-8/10 not for heavy games.Ram-8/10 for small application it is ok but heavy games restart again. Battery - 10/10 andCharging - 10/10. Overall a good package must look phone. Here are some samples."
73,2.0,There is frequent call disconnection while using this phone.,Working professionals should not buy this phone because there is frequent call disconnection. I have been using this phone for the last more than a month. 2/3 calls go smooth otherwise all calls get disconnected itself. Sometimes it hangs but not much. The video quality of screen recording is very poor. I have no much use of camera so I can't share it's experience. Speakers are not of that much quality which have written on the phone's box or whatever have been told in various reviews. There is all from my side. Do read this review before buying this phone.
74,4.0,A Mediocre Phone,"I got this phone just as a backup phone. Used since last 10+ days.  Here are the pros and consPros:* Good battery Life and fast charger, charges at real fast.* Look and Feel of the Blue Color is good, other colors were not impressive* Alexa works really well.Cons:* Camera is not too good and selfie camera is too worse. I still own a Redmi note 4, those camera samples are better than Redmi Note 11.* Even normal games like Township, etc. are lagging though i got the 6GB RAM phone* 90Hz or 60 Hz, i could not see any difference in the screen refresh rate.So if you just want a phone and wanted to enjoy the long battery life, this is the phone. You can take some mediocre pictures and calls, messages,...I will upload the review video in Dr. PradeepKumar Vlog in Youtube shortly."
75,1.0,Absolutely fraud,"My new phone got blank within a month. Once battery discharged, not charging. Only charging symbol showing. Screen got totally blanked. Completely fraud by redmi. Dont but from redmi. I already heard by others users too, but i bought this due to low cost now turned into heavy caused for me."
76,4.0,Review after 10 days usage,"I was a honor play user before switching to this mobile. Biggest thing about this mobile is AMOLED display , its punchy and black looks so cool. 90hz didnt make much difference in daily usage for me . Charging is also great as it charges from 10 to 100 in just 1 hr. About MiUi i think everyone is over exaggerating about the ads problem - u can turn off every unwanted notification , lock screen ad , app scanner everything . Most of the apps / bloat wares can be uninstalled. About ram , decent ram management 6gb + 1gb ram expansion. Storage youll get only 40 gb free. Just experienced a device freeze issue today , other than it everything is good in daily usage. Phone warms a bit when used in sunlight and some heavy tasks. Other than that in normal usage No heating issue.Conclusion ::Buy if u r a normal user who is focused on multimedia consumptionGamers stay away ."
77,1.0,Worst Mobile ever from Redmi at this price range,Only one word Never Buy if you want good quality camera. I have replaced the mobile but both phone having poor video quality during video call. It not 50 MP camera i think it is below 5 MP. Nevet expected from this quality phone from this price range. More option available better than this at same price. In last don't buy it if you want good camera phone.

79,2.0,Never buy if you're looking for a good Camera Phone.,"I must say this phone is the worst purchase i have ever made. Yes the phone is offered in a very good pricing but don't fall for that. If you're a person who is looking for a budget phone with good performance and average camera, No this is not for you. This phone is made for gifting purposes, one who is upgrading from a keypad mobile who doesn't know how a mobile camera works. Looks like the camera used in this device is recycled from some old devices. I once owned a Redmi Note 3 which had a better camera than this. Okay next to the perfomances, utterly disappointed basic using apps like instagram is dropping fps while watching videos, what kind of phone is this man. Felt like complaint but relaised from reddit discussions that it's a common issue. Overall this is a downgraded device with just ascending number values in model name. Never fall for this trap. Oh i forgot about charging never use this phone while charging if you want to charge the phone in a day."
80,1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS.,"The Camera and Performance is really badI have been regretting ever since I bought this. I bought the 128gb variant with 6gb ram. Any reviewer who recommending this is lying. The Display is good but the performance is so bad it really would not matter. The Speaker is loud but the Clarity is really bad compared to samsung m42.  The Camera and Performance is really bad. I thought the snapdragon 680 would be better than my phone with sd665 but the UI is laggy due to MIUI / This processor is not able to handle 1080p.  Camera is terrible compared to my 10k phone which I bought 5 years ago ! . The Camera smoothens out everything and it is VERY BLURRY. It feels like cataract in my eye. The phone has connectivity issues , Wi-fi goes on and off again and again. That is probably again due to MIUI. There are no custom ROMs available for this to make any use of this.  The cellular signal is also wavering again and again. Even after the latest updates . Better buy Samsung m53 or OnePlus CE lite 2 compared to this. And if you still wanna purchase this I will be selling this on OLX for 2 - 3k lower. There will be many like me to sell it there so you will get someone. If you can wait for a year for a new phone that would be the best choice as it seems all snapdragon phones are a downgrade this time. But this is just terrible even if you take out the processor out of the equation. Buy a 10k phone or else don't buy anything in this price range at all."
81,1.0,"You Can't use Google pay, paytm","CheatedDon't buy this phone it doesn't have capacity for multitasking if you switch between recent apps it gets restarts. Due to this you can't book train tickets or other utilities bill through UPI like GooglePay, paytmNow a days most preferred option is UPI if you buy this phone you can't use it then why should you buy this"
82,2.0,Disgusting Product From Redmi..,"I Bought this product from Amazon on 16th April.. Now I notice the camera quality is very poor not like that 50mp just to me xiaomi. Then request to Amazon replace the product Amazon also provide me home service technician but my product not to be solve.. Please don't purchase this product go for othar brands like Samsung, poco, and realme they also provide  you better value for money.. I waste my money.. I expect from xiaomi.."
83,3.0,Downgraded phones is bad 2022 trend,"Try and get a second hand Redmi Note 10 (predecessor to this ph) which is a way better experience. From chipset to haptics to fingerprint scanner, the older one has it better. And power efficiency wise the deal is muddy too because Note 11 processors are using an older architecture."

85,3.0,Overall I want to say that redmi is degrading it's quality with newer phones,(1)The phone has given 50MP Primary camera but it is worst than a 16MP camera also 13 MP front camera is not as expected.(2)The processor is good but heating issue always occurs when you listen song then also it happens.(3)Battery backup is good and display is also goodOverall I want to say that phone price is too high and if you can then don't buy this phone.
86,4.0,Good product but need some improvement,"Nice phone by Redmi. But few improvements needed like fingerprint readers has some delay sometime to unlock the device. Came performance is good bright day light but in artificial light it is not so good where other devices from different brands has better camera performance. Battery life is really good, charging speed is damn good with provided 33 watt fast charger. Display is nice and crisp color saturation is good. 90hz works fine. Stereo speakers provide really clear and loud aound.I gifted this device to my mom and she really likes it.Hope finger print and camera performance are improved bybproviding software update."
87,1.0,Pathetic phone,"Worst camera, worst sound quality I have seen in a phone. It's a trap @‚Çπ14000 by showing configuration but performance isn't worth, my button phone of ‚Çπ600 had better sound & camera. They won't take returns even within return priod, but how a technician will solve poor quality components problems?"
88,4.0,Worth buying at 15 k,"Redmi note 11 is a great budget phone for day-to-day usage.(Used it for almost a month)Date: March 4th, 2022Pros:1. Battery will last for a whole day with a single charge for heavy users, I personally got over 7 hours of screen time.2. Screen is a very good amoled panel with nice details and colour accuracy. Although display is slightly on a warmer tone.3. Overall multimedia experience on this device is best in budget segment.4. Performance is decent for day-to-day activities not recommended for gaming though.Cons:Camera is the only and the biggest compromise on this device.It takes very bad photos from all the rear cameras(main, ultra wide, macro).Very bad picture quality and just awful, it take a yellowish tone photos. Max video recording available is just 1080p 30fps.üôÅSummary : If u are looking for a phone for gaming or good cameras then this device is not for you. Else a good phone for multimedia, battery performance, etc."
89,1.0,Earphone port not working,"It's my sincere request to everyone that if you are buying the product,check properly the earphone ports.I bought the phone on 22-02-22 but did not check the earphone ports.After 5-6 days of phone use I thought of using earphones ,but to my surprise it came that only one part of the earphone was having sound.Initially I thought that there might be an issue with the earphone but when I used the same earphones on a different handset it worked properly.Also the phone is little bit laggy.Also we can't use multiple apps by minimising themThe only advantage is it charges up quickly.Overall the product is not worth ,but in this amount what we can expect.Truly disappointed"
90,1.0,Returned - Very slow and jittery even in day to day use,I bought this device after using a Redmi note 7 for 2.5 years.I was amazed how the same RAM of 4 GB was surprisingly low for this new device- with a SD processor.The overall phone is good and the camera is good in daylight conditions (nothing exceptional).I got the phone replaced with a 6GB variant and now I am satisfied.
91,4.0,Value for money,"Phone to achha h,lekin kuch kuch feature hata liye gye h jaise second space aur dual app jo ki mein HILIGHTING feature tha... Ye bahut galat kiya gya h..... üò≠üò≠üò≠üò°üò°"

93,4.0,Compact and value for money phone in this price range,Redmi note 11 is a good option in this price range. Its compact design and size is good.Descent gaming performance.Pros:-90hz amoled display id awesome-battery life is very good-33w fast charger. 15-100% in 1.15hrs-stereo speakers-Snapdragon processorCons:-camera is not that much good- minute bugs in ui
94,5.0,The best in this price range without a doubt,"One of the best multimedia viewer phone in this price range, I got it for around 11k under an offer so the value for money is high although if you are planning for a high graphics and stable gaming phone then this isn‚Äôt the but it still is good enough, and yes you can bgmi in it but of course there will be difference of quality gaming, camera is good enough in this range but don‚Äôt expect much, it‚Äôs as good as other phone (once again, in this price range) and the best in terms of viewing experience (like ott streaming and all). Just one thing that I would say is I am still waiting for the Android 12 update in this phone, don‚Äôt know when can I get it."
95,1.0,Very bad mobile looking nice but hang problem and heating mobile don't parchase,"The phone is not good because its camera is also not that special nor does it have any special features like it is Android Thirteen, but I don't think so.  This is good because it hangs and this article is also hot too so read the news once before buying it because after 21 days my phone got damaged and it is in service center since last 1 month  I have it, but I can not get it due to non-availability of its part, so I do not think that this phone is that good.  better is take vivo phone all"
96,3.0,Do not buy (for camera sake),"First of all camera is absolute trash. Idk if it's the software or the lens.. But this camera doesn't even perform against a 2 year old redmi note.Otherwise the mobile is good, great haptics. Nice screen. Speakers are good. Also the black variant doesn't really look like that displayed picture on Amazon. It doesn't have any gradient irl (idk about other color versions)Anyway hope this helped"
97,4.0,Good phone. Worth it for daily use. Also professional use.,I like the product. Mostly I use it for office works. It has been performing well.Just 1 thing I miss is that dual apps feature which was built in before when I used redmi note 5 that is missing in redmi note 11.I can still use that with 3rd party apps but not that smooth as it should be. Dual apps are laggy with 3rd party.
98,4.0,mi UI need to be improved,"As a user of different UIs (Realme, mi and stock Android), mi UI needa to be improved.mi UI << Realme UI  ‚âà stock Android-- double tap to lock the screen (on home screen) is not available in mi UI-- some screen gestures are missing-- better to give finger print sensor at some other place ( long usage of power button will impact the sensor)-- need to improve signal receptionOther then above points this is good phone  with good display and battery life"
99,1.0,Phone reboots self and crashes while unlocking and opening certain apps,"It is possible that I got a faulty phone. I never had a experience of getting a faulty phone so it pissed me off.The phone hangs , reboots self in loop and crashes while opening certain apps.Over all not a happy purchase."
100,5.0,A Great Phone In This Price Range,"Yes! the camera is mediocre at best. Yes! the fingerprint reader fails to read the fingerprints most of the time.Still it is a great phone in this price range. It never lags, the screen is brighter than my iPhone 12, the screen is big hence media consumption and reading is blissful.Just a recommendation, get a 128 GB variant. I filled up my 64 GBs within a month of using it and I didn't install any games or download a lot of movies."
101,4.0,Best Amoled Phone in this price range.,pros:1. Overall performance of this phone is very good in this price range.2. Battery backup is superb.3. 90Hz Screen provides smooth viewing experience and touch is also good.4. Double speakers are quite loud with streo effects.5. Light weight and good for one hand usage.6. Camera quality is decent.Cons:1. Screen dimming issue in lower brightness.2. Double tap touch is slower.3. Proximity Sensor is not that much accurate.4. 90 Hz mode is not optimized for most of the 3rd party apps. Many times you will find screen jitter.
102,4.0,Almost perfect budget phone.,"Will try to keep this short for prospective buyers.PROs1) Stunning Display. The Amoled display really stands out, compared to previous phones.2) Loud double sided audio, adds to the experience of multimedia. Watched my favourite movie Blade Runner 2049 on it and it was quite an experience.3) Fast recharge and good battery life despite heavy use.4) Finger lock, face lock and haptics are good.CONs1) Camera is average. It's not bad, but the pics in night mode or dim light are terrible.2) Not that great for gaming.At 13500/- it has more pros than cons. And the cons aren't that bad either."

105,3.0,Good for multimedia consumption only.,"Pros:Decent build qualityGood screenVery good speakersVery good battery lifeCons:The camera sucks. Like it straight up sucks. I've used moto g31 and that has a way better camera.MiUi is a pain, even though it's better than before. Many bugs and random annoyances.GPS tracking in maps is a big problem on the 4gb version. The phone keeps losing track of gps.Performance is pretty bad. I'm not a heavy gamer, but I'm sure this phone cannot handle heavy tasks.Verdict: if your main requirement is to surf the internet, watch YouTube videos etc, only then this phone is for you. Otherwise there are much better options like moto g31."
106,5.0,Budget phone,This is a budget friendly phone where the battery will easily last a full day even if you go surfing the web all day long. Screen is decent LED and you can find yourself that the processor does not heat up even if you play games on this device. Everything works just fine. Camera is a normal one... Just like any other MI used to be... This is not a flagship mechine as you know... So do not expect a mind blowing performance but expect for a efficient all day support for our day to day tasks...
107,4.0,Good phone under 15K,I was to get an additional 2000 rupee discount on exchange sadly I got no exchange since my phone had a slight crack in it. As of today the phone is working fine. Only problem is no 5 G. If you use a phone only for a year 5g isn't a game changer you can go for it. Fast charging at 33W. Snapdragon 680 is supposed to perform better than mediatek you be the judge.
108,1.0,Not upto the mark,"Does not perform inspite of 6gb ram. Frequent app exits seen while app is in usage. Camera quality is bad, surely not as mentioned in the description. Finger print sensor at back seems better than to the right side as it can have better finger ratio to sensor. All this is annoying when your old mi was better than new one.Hugely Disappointed.On top of that I later noticed that my piece had scratch guard pasted which is not the case with brand new piece. Seems I got refurbished product in price of new one."

¬†Ghost touch. Automatic touching screen. I ordered Redmi Note 11 Pro Plus and Redmi Note 11. Same problem in Both. Please don't buy Redmi Note 11 series. There are many Hardware issues due to which ghost touch is happening. And Amazon not helping me in returning or replacing the mobile. Amazon will just say technician will come to check mobile and he will never come, he will just call and will say to factory reset. But ghost touch is coming after factory reset also."
110,2.0,Not worth it,"Very odd thing is not getting OTP SMS!!! On resending it works at times. Switched back to old mobile and it is working.Camera - main is just OK, selfie mode is not good.Sound - Average, need to be in full to hear movies"
111,1.0,"Very Poor Performance, Network and Connectivity issues.",I regret to purchase this phone. Very few technical YouTube and Instagram reviews are available where they say this phone is just need to throw in garbage. Don't buy phone üì± less than Mediatek 810 or Snapdragon 8** series. We live in India and network is not same everywhere. OLED screen means customer cannot buy crap for this. Xiaomi started to cheat and results are being shown on many online retailers that sell is dropping everyday.
112,1.0,Not as expected!,"After much hyped, i bought my first Redmi phone(note 11) with full excitement. Loved the looks at first but looks dont matter they say üôÉ and its true. The camera is below average, too much noise, the fingerprint response is kinda slow and surprisingly the battery life draines faster to every use! And the screen is just too sensitive. A slight slide and it already drew a crack and because of which i am writing this preview. Software is okay though. Honest review. Im not saying you should buy it or you shouldnt becausr everyone has their preference. But personally im let down by this particular model."
113,4.0,Good looking and very well designed budget smartphone.,"Pros:- The placement of stereo speakers is perfect and sound quality is Fantastic üòç.- Fingerprint reader is also in the right position and it's quick.- Performance is top notch.- ram and storage is fast- Fast charging is very helpful.Cons:- Bad quality camera, I would say just keep  1 rear + 1 front camera of better quality."

115,4.0,"Mixed bag, be mindful of what you're looking for in the phone","I could be way more technical but as a day to day user, here's what you know. The camera is mediocre at best, MIUI is bloated and not a polished software and is not fun to use by any means. But the display is very good and the battery life is pretty great, 33w fast charging and an included charger of that same rating on a phone which starts at 13k is good to have. If you need a good display and a long battery this phone is a good option, if camera is your priority or you expect good software then this phone ain't gonna be it chief."
116,3.0,Unbreakable,"I bought this phone as Poco X3 Pro was not available at that time. After using Poco M2 Pro, the display size is smaller and i cannot believe it has amoled display. The only benefit is, my kid throwed this phone so many times but phone is not broken which is good for me :) Poco M2 screen is like glass if you drop once it will be broken so this phone has advantage of this. Apart from that  charging speed is good and it has dual speaker so you can enjoy multimedia content.So far phone working good."
117,4.0,Overall performance is good .,I have a balanced usages like i use for gaming or heavy multi-tasking . In work ( job) this phones battery works great. If you are heavy user like me in end of day you will 26-21% battery. And that a good part. It comes with turbocharger with 33w charger in box and trust me it charges really fast. In this price range phone is great.
118,5.0,Mom likes this phone.,"My mother's only priority was a good bright display under sunlight, small thin compact design and loud speakers. Purchased it for my mother. She is a very lite users. This phone is best suited for elders."
119,3.0,NOT A CAMERA PHONE AND GAMING PHONE,"I have Redmi note 7s,i have purchased this to replace it,but it disappoint me for camera quality,as my previous phone has 48MP camera and shoots good quality image against this 50MP camera. also this phone has same series processor as my previous one but this phone has good battery back up via latest processor.If you are buying this phone for only basic phone purpose,then only it is best option to get it. otherwise go for other mobiles."
120,3.0,Just okay phone at a higher price,"Just okay phone, did not expect this from MI. I have been using MI phones since last 8 years and they all were awesome but this one is not up to the mark.. Camera is pathetic and for gaming purpose it's useless as no hd graphics for BGMI available in this device.. I regret my decision of buying this.. I should have bought samsung in this price range."

I raised return / replacement, amazon sent technical person after 3 days, he visited and installed some tool and mentioned every thing is ok, even I asked him to use mobile and check, he said tool shows everything ok. I called customer care they say since technician says its ok we can not give any replacement or return. This is really terrible technician simply depends on tool, god knows how tool checks voice clarity. Amazon seems doing big fraud by sending faulty phone."
123,4.0,Good phone for media consumption in this price range.,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Pros : Good phone for media consumption in this price range(I got it for ‚Çπ11300). Camera quality is average sometimes good in outdoor condition. Compact and lightweight.Cons : MIUI optimization is not so good. Still no Android 12 update. There is no Auto option for screen refresh rate, either 60 or 90Hz only."
124,3.0,Average Phone,"Using it for last 20 days, bought in sale @10800/- Very average phone with average camera, Call features specially Google dialer is really very slow, no miui dailer which was good in previous phones, good amoled display,Battery life is average, I am not a gamer, charge once in a day, single day battery life,Recommend only if you want average phone in budget, else there are more good phones in comparision to this."
125,4.0,Touch quality and Audio quality is amazing at this price,"Hey guys, I have used it for more than a month now on basis of that I've given my review underneath.PROS1. Comes with inbuilt 33W charger2. Audio quality is superb at this price range3. Touch quality is really smooth4. You get transparent case in the box5. Battery will last approx 2 days for the normal users.CONS1. Camera quality is not that great as earlier I was using Note 7 pro and it had 48MP cam which was far better than this.2. Sometimes the auto brightness doesn't work properly (This might happen that my handset have some sensor issues)I got it for 11,700 on sale and I think in this price range this is a good to go option with trusted brand."
126,3.0,Copy of cheap Phones,"I had use almost Phones of mi, this is the worth phone ever, it's a totally copy of realme, oppo, vivo...Redmi you should have to copy as per your level like apple and samsung.#too much light weight phone feel like nothing inside üòÜ, it should be little heavy if it have 5000mah battery#performance is too slow in gamming.#Phone have good display amoled, it is also not as samsung gives you super amoled"
127,4.0,Camera Quality needs to improve,"*Camera quality can be improved.*Everything else looks good for this price, I bought it for INR 12000.*If you use camera once or twice in a week for normal selfie or documents scanning then its perfect for you.*Not for content creator or specially girls who are much active on Social media*Although picture quality improves after using AI filter and some more settings (you need to adjust as per requirement).*Battery performance is good as Redmi phones are better than other brands like oppo vivo or realme.*I can bet camera quality is far better than Realme smartphones in this range and even at some higher price.*Gaming can be done but not for long duration.*Best for parents and age group 40+ (who use phones for basic use).*Snapdragon makes it smooth.*I am sure it will be all good for 3-4 years of use...Disclaimer : This is my personal opinion as I am a tech geek and has used almost every range phone."
128,3.0,Poor memory Management,"Good phone with good specs. But management of internal memory is very poor, especially for 64 gb version. System and apps take away 90% of memory. Sd card is an absolute must for 64 gb version."
129,3.0,First time I'm writing a review for Mobile - Not better than MI Note 10S,"I'm using Redmi Note 10s for 6months. Thought of upgrading to next level so i bought Note 11. After one days of usage i came to know i got a downgraded mobile.-Camera performance very very poor.-Note 10s performs faster than Note 11-video recording is smooth only in 720p, strucks in 1080p-others are all same as Note 10sBut still Redmi is the only brand giving us good specifications for lower Price. Thatsy i have given 3stars.I hope Redmi team will rectify the performance issues by updates. Let's see............--------------------------------------------------------------------Updating after 7days of usage  -found Auto brightness is not working properly. Very very irritating. Very low brightness and keeps changing even I'm not moving.  -Camera Image stabilization and zoom is not good like Note 10s."
130,5.0,Value for money Redmi note 11,"I was confused üòÖ a little bit before buying this against Readmi note 10s which was equipped with gaming processor. Finally I cancelled Note10s and purchased Readmi note 11.HighlightsGreat screen quality Amoled 90hzBattery life almost 2 days, with out internet goes upto 3 days.Without lag day to day daily task.No heating issue.Sleek design, sides are squared shape.Downside.Camera may disappoint you it is okay okay.Overall the phone üì± is awesome."
131,2.0,Worst camera quality,Not very impressive the phone has really bad camera at this range also the bulid quality is not good.. i would suggest you to go for narzo 50 and save 500rs instead.. Also i had discovered some ui problem with this phone that when u connect it through the usb to pc the option files transfer didn't show.
132,5.0,5star,"Light weight, excellent battery backup (2days) , good camera, no heating issues. I got this for my dad and I am using one plus 6, after looking at resmi note 11, I am planning to get one for me....close your eyes and buy it."
133,3.0,Problem of hanging,"The phone bad ptsVery slowGets hangedResponse is delayedGood pointsDisplay fineReview - at this rate quality of product of Redmi is very poor compared to other company phones. One must see that even if it has good RAM but the phone isn't responding the way it should, it is very very slow. Gets hanged sometimes. And it has been just two months of usage. So think before you buy."
134,1.0,Don't consider this mobile as an option at all,"After using this mobile for more than 40 days I found that there are lot of issues which need need to be rectified. Some of them which irritated me a lot are:(i) Mobile crashes frequently. Doesn't feel like 4 GB RAM & 64 GB memory. I felt my last mobile red mi 6A which comes with 2GB RAM 16 GB memory worked far better than this one.(ii) Apps won't resume where you left, they start afresh. You can't even a listen to/ watch a video if you keep your mobile idle for more than half an hour.(iii) Even though you stop auto notifications from default MI apps such as Themes , they keep on displaying. I did really wonder how settings are getting changed automatically even though I deny them consent every time.(vi) Zomato, Swiggy, Amazon apps show the items in cart itself even though order gets placed. It gives mental agony when I had to recheck twice whether I had placed an order or not. Issue becomes scarier when you place a food order and happen to find items in cart itself when I had to check the status of delivery.I really feel that I did a blunder purchasing this mobile (specifications 4 GB RAM and 64 GB memory) for Rs. 10,499 in amazon mega sale last month. After watching this mobile priced at Rs. 13,499 I won't recommend at all which takes away your mental peace along with your money."
135,4.0,Phone is excellent except camera quality as it is very poor or below average.,"Pixels are not clear and photos are blurred when zoomed even little bit so details are not provided as per 50 megapixel or ultra wide.It's night camera is worst and too poorIf anyone looking for good phone not camera quality then this is one of the best in stereo dual speakers, amoled screen, fingerprint sensor, processor but it looking for camera then don't purchase this phone.I request to mi that please improve your camera quality of pictures as it is not completely dependent on megapixel but also sensor, pixel size so better to focus there not megapixel, thanks."

137,1.0,"Worst phone, don't waste your money","It's the worst phone I have ever used. The performance is aweful. App opening speed and overall responsiveness of the phone is very bad. It visibly stuggles even with basic daily apps. Even SD680, 6gb RAM, UFS 2.2 storage are not able to help the phone to perform.Camera is worst as well. Please don't waste your hard earned money on this phone."
138,1.0,Faulty Mobile | Got No replacement and  No Refund,I have received a faulty mobile.Example: play/pause button will never hide when you play in YouTube. The part of glass on the phone overlaps with the front camera.The Technician visited and rejected replacement/refund saying its app issue and no defects. Now I have to use this faulty mobile as it has become nuisance reach out out Amazon Customer care for replacement/refund. They wasted 4 hours of time daily for 4 days. Asked me to raise request again and get harassed. So better buy a new mobile outside and forget the money I paid to Amazon.
139,3.0,Don't Buy,"Review thoda bada but but ek bar dhyan se padhiye,Katega apka isko buy kiye to, price aur specification ke according acha mobile h and mai gamer nhi hu, normal user hu.Real issue bata hu ab jo ki apko kahi bhi review me nhi milegaWhatsapp video call, Duo video call, and direct video call, ek sbd me kahu to video calling me picture dark and blur ata hai jo ki sch me bahut hi dispointing h.Mere mobile me battery issue and network issue ta to jaise taise replace kiya and replacement me jo mobile ayega usme bhi video calling same isi tarah blur and dark picture ata h.So conclusion ye h ki maine 2 mobile iske use kiye dono ke video calling me issue rhe, to mai kah sakta hu ki is model ke sath me hi issue h.To Buy mat kijiye bahut regret feel krengeThank you"

The snapdragon processor & Battery backup is good, light weight slim mobile.Cons: The only problem is with miui 13. The ui is very smooth and fast not many bloat ware or advertisement . But in this ui company has disabled the individual app dark mode function. I hope they re-enable that option in future. Also I can't connect the phone with pc via usb. Overall the mobile is great & value for money. Happy to using it."
144,5.0,"Recording feature is not good, else the handset is too good.","Nice slimy model, with great output. The only problem is with the recorder, it informs the recipient that we are recording the call. this is the only recording feature i didnt like, else I would have purchased 2nd handset. Other than this feature its a very nice handset."
145,5.0,Best phone under 15k,"It's been a while since I changed to new phone but even though the display and battery backup is exceptional. The battery life is probably because of the efficiency of the processor. Absolutely loving the 90Hz and the blacks of amoled.However in indoor lighting conditions camera quality is not so good but in daylight it's very good especially the 50mp mode looks like we're using dslr. Weight and thickness of the phone is pretty good too.The software is in serious need of update still stuck on Android 11 but miui is version 13.Highly recommend this one, it's like redmi note 10 pro lite and not a note 10 normal successor."
146,5.0,Gift and it‚Äôs perfect,I have purchased this to my friends brother as he was having online classes he is loving the product for his classes and regular usage. Battery life and display quality is fantastic.Yet to check the camera quality and other bench Marks. As of now it‚Äôs a decent product to buy under 16K.
147,2.0,Worst Phone from RedMi Note Series,"‚Ä¢ Camera : Worst Camera at this price. Not even up to mark from last series like Redmi Note 9.‚Ä¢ Display : Although they say it is AMOLED, but it feels same as that of normal phones. Its just hype. 90Hz or 60hz feels the same way.‚Ä¢ Z-Axis Vibration Motor : There is no practical use of this motor. I think most of people keep phone on silent(at least me), You will not even notice that your phone is vibrating when get call on silent mode.‚Ä¢ Battery : Battery is good and quick charge is also good. But now I am using from 1 month, it is not better as it was at starting day for quick charge.‚Ä¢ Processor : Average processor for this price. I don't play games so it is between good and best.Overall Experience with this: Not that good, not price worthy."
148,1.0,Poor performer,"Extremely poor performance of both software and hardware. Camera quality is pathetic, even more so while shooting video. Takes time to latch on to GPS.

Battery life has greatly improved with the new processor. In hand feel has greatly improved. Camera are okayish, getting what we are paying for.

It takes great photos and has all the MiUi features.Processor: The processor is ok for the price and it is not suited for very heavy use. The phone does heat up if used heavily for some time like playing games and using some heavy apps.Look and Feel: The phone looks awesome especially the blue color and feels nice in hand.Battery and Charging: It will do fine for the day in case of moderate use and you can charge it pretty quickly with the bundled fast charger.

Too much technical and software issues in this, so I suggest to never buy this version, Note 11, 11s, 11 pro  11T, 11 5G. All are same issues. Main to fans hi gaya lekar per aap sab mat fansiyega."
163,1.0,Upset with Redmi company,"Totally unexpected thing happened with this purchase. I was in hurry as I was going for a tour next day. There was no Sim ejector pin in the box... Brand new phone.... With so much price tag and it's mentioned that you will get sim ejector pin in the box. One may think it's a small thing, but not. When you are time-bound situation, a simple thing like pin can create havoc. It is so difficult to open sim slot without that pin. As a guy, I don't have a safety pin with me. It took lot of time to find out a way. So I am very upset with the company for such inconvenience. Never expected this such a big brand."
164,1.0,The worst phone from redmi never ever buy this phone you will lose your hard earned money,First of all it was good for few days i mean the battery was fine the camera quality was worst and it stopped working After few days I went to customer service I mean service center they asked me to pay 1500 for the camera though it was in warranty I have just used it for 26days and after 4days it got totally dead even I am not getting any help from the service center very bad experience of redmi I have used around 6-8phone of redmi but never had this much issue I should give 0 star for this brand
165,4.0,Waste service by Amazon,Phone is nice but the issue with the instant bank cashback the thing is they don't give instant cashback and wen we as a customer take the issue to customer service the response is worst they ask u to wait for cashback for 5 working days now it's almost 15 working days still haven't recieved my cashback and in this 15days I atleast called 6times for the same stl the response everytime is wait for 2-3working days ......worst every service by AmazonThis is how u treat the customer ...!!!! Amazon should be ashamed of there customer service department as well as other department services...... TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED ...... IF U R THINKING TO BUY WITH CASHBACK DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT
166,1.0,Terrible product at this price.,The phone is a very basic one. No where the screen looks close to an amoled one.I upgraded from note 7 but this is actually a downgrade.Images are pixelated. Camera looks like the one in basic phones.The worst thing is it does not have auto focus. It's a fixed focus cam.Not happy with the phone at all.Battery is good.
167,3.0,Very very poor camera Remaining is Good,Nice Display for that price range its too smoothSound quality also good with 2 top and bottom speakersEasy 1 day battery life for above moderate user. And charging also preety fast woth 33w pro chargerOnly big disappointment is CAMERA.its really worst. They said its 50MP camera but feels like 2MP basic phone camera.not alla good both back and front camera.If camera is not a problem for you.you can grab this budget phone.
168,2.0,90Hz is a scam,"I have a Oneplus 8T, My mother bought this phone after her old one died but the difference is clear. The 90Hz display lags a lot it does not feel like a 90hz phone, it feels like a normal 60hz screen. The camera quality is not that great. The display doesn't feel like an AMOLED but it gets the job done."
169,1.0,NOT A GOOD BUY,I bought this phone as my previous phones were Xiaomi MI and thought transition to a new phone would be seamless as I am used to the MI os.But totally disappointed as dialler and messaging Is google and not miui. It's so confusing and not user friendly. I feel like flinging this phone out and may do it soon.2 months use still I feel this phone dialler is 2 steps back. Not a good phone
170,4.0,Best phone in 15k budget,Overall the phone is very good.Pros:Loved the quality of display.Good features.Very long battery life.Premium Matte Look.Cons:Automatic brightness very bad.Phone gets lava like hot when charging.Camera quality not that much good.
171,3.0,Good Phone But Worst Camera Quality,Using redmi devices from Redmi 1s but fast time facing this type of worst camera on a note series devices Redmi 10 Prime also have same issue I think miui is not optimized from 50MP sensor hope they will fixed this otherwise will think twice to buy a Redmi Note
172,2.0,Redmi Note 11 review,"The snapdragon processor is too slow, there is no big difference in refresh rate change seems like similar refresh rate working only for OTT apps and not for the system app, very slow finger print reader doesn't have a clue whether it is due to finger print app or processor. Overall working performance is fair, after using for 3 months more problem keeps on coming charging is not perfectly done and phone kepts hanging now i am convinced to buy new phone with an exchange, I expected a decent performance but redmi delivered low performance phone, gone disappointed."
173,3.0,Defective cam poor processor n ram! Best battery backup! Surprising animations,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Worst part of the mobile is camera front n back.... It's somewhat ok in day time captures but night shoots are damly poor!!! And simply takes time to focus in day time too!!....2nd thing poor processor n slow ram  even 6gb ram takes time to start an app primarily pre installed app like calling.....it takes time to dial n time in process of calling.... Sadly very slow to experience the uses!!!!Good at fingerprint sensor...senses good.Best battery backup.... Continue usage still gives one whole day till end of charge16k is too cost for its performance"
174,5.0,Best in price segment,Best display.Good processor.33watt fast charging and the adapter is included in box. Works superfast.Camera could have in better.Overall better than Samsung galaxy M32.. the nearest competitor in this segment (Using both the phones).
175,4.0,Good battery backup,"Overall phone is excellent, smooth experience, easy full day battery while using it for calls and messaging, YouTube etc. Only problem is the camera.. It's not good at all.. If you are not a shutterbug... This phone is excellent"
176,1.0,Great phone in every aspect but cuz of the ui everything renders useless and limited,MiUi is trash. It won't even let a music player keep playing in the background. This phone is a epic but the MIUI GODDMN MIUI. Effing trash.
177,2.0,"Not at all value for money, very poor camera quality",Battry life is good. Phone gets heated if used for a long time. Camera is very poor. Very hard to use for new users. The camera quality is very poor. UI of the ph is also not user friendly. To delete multiple contacts at a time or to search apps from the existing applicatons installed are very difficult. In fact the is no option for this. Not at all value for money phone.
178,1.0,Bad Experience,"Charger defect..!I bought this mobile 3 months before. Mobile is good n working but the problem is charger. When I buy this product charger was fine n good However, upon 3 month of using it, problems started to appear. It getting melt and getting open edges of the charging cable. Very very poor quality. If u don't want charger then buy this product. I used to complaint about the charger but they don't want to listen...My advise is, if u want mobile for only three month then buy this product."
179,4.0,Moderate handset.. Sometimes its lag,Positv : grt energy efficiency by SD 680 with amoled display..Easily it lasts 12 hour of continues usage..Slim and perfect for griping in handLooks grtDisplay size is perfectNgtv: it lags sometimes..Camera is not up to the markFront camera is vary low avrgSound is avrg...Otherwise in this price point its not a bad deal...
180,5.0,Great purchasw,I have exchanged my 5 year used Redmi 3s and received 4k cashback.Bought Note 11 4/64 at 8500 after Citibank cc apply.Amoled at this price made the experience super amazing.
181,1.0,Worst Service and Worst Product,"Phone lags very much. I asked Amazon to refund it, they told me they will refund only after technician visit. After technician inspection, he also confirmed and concluded that phone is lagging very much. He gave his analysis result to Amazon. But till now I didn't received any refund confirmation from Amazon. Worst Service.Advice to others: Before buying any mobile, tablet or laptop from Amazon, if possible, please go and have a test of that device from its respective showroom. It will give idea of device looks and performance."
182,5.0,Practical phone,"No regrets after buying this phone. Very balanced and complete phone. I haven't found any downside yet. Display, battery life, charging speed, speakers, call quality is very good. Camera is above average and UI is also very clean, however, auto brightness sensor is not calibrated properly which could be fixed in future updates."
183,2.0,Not happy with this purchase,Actually i bought it for a reason which was exchange offer but only one thing whicch is cool amoled screen rest camera so cold dual speaker even battery life is not sounds like good.Caution- buy it if you are gonna use this device only for 1 or 1-2 years.Redmi sets are usually lasts for 1- 2 years.I am very much disappointed with the purchase.
184,5.0,Best processer,"Phone is running very much smooth and fast. After a heavy use neither a lag or heating issue noticed so far. Excellent camera, producing extra ordinary images. You will love that selfie pics. ‚ù§Ô∏è #NOTE11"
185,3.0,Good phone with horrible camera,"Note 11 is a decent phone. I bought it at rs 10,400 for 64gb+4gb version. With this price its a steal deal.Camera is horrible so dont Even consider this if camera is your priority.Tonnes of bloatware by Xiaomi but all of these can be uninstalled using adb desktop app. Just search it on Youtube for complete tutorial.Battery life is amazing. UI is good. Not recommended for games. Display is nice."
186,1.0,refurbished piece,"Amazon selling at low rate prices mobile phone but it's a refurbished piece and we don't know about that if you check your mobile phone clearly so you can see that it is the refurbished piece... My mobile phones' camara quality is too much poor and battery charging slowly, also didn't work notifications animation and many more"
187,4.0,I would say a good product at this price segment,Writing this review after Using this mobile from last 1 month.Camera is normal. The worst part of camera is not having Stability.Sound quality - sound is awesome earphone as well as normalVideo quality is good as it is having amoled displayThe main dislike is you cannot watch high quality reels video with this mobile it get fluctuations issue and voice cracking issue in this mobileOverall a good not best but a good phone in this price segment. If you have a normal under 15 budget you can opt this mobile
188,3.0,Disappointed by the performance...,"Display is good and bright enough in direct sunlight. I am gonna talking about the problems faced. 2-3 times I had faced hanging problem,means the phone was hanged completely,I have to restart it. Other than that,I have faced problems in brightness, it automatically increases or reduces by itself when you use it in sunlight. 2 times I had faced the colours imbalanced in display. After coming form sunlight into dark room or low light area, the display becomes gyerish or greenish, again have to restart for proper colouring of display."
189,5.0,Very Good,Value for Money...Display Excellent....Smooth Ui ExperienceCamera good according to the PriceOverall Very Good
190,1.0,Problem in less than a month.,"In less than a month the device is giving issues, always shows memory full while there in not much data is stored. Getting on and off on itself. No support from amazon. No technical help number in product page also."
191,3.0,Batter and front camera performing poor,"Front camera is pathetic whatsApp video calling, it gives false colors and blackish appearance. Not sure if it is specific to this piece or the model in general.Batter lasts only a day (I am not a heavy user, don't play games)Back camera is decent; lighter; screen is good;"
192,3.0,Not worth for the money,If you are a Normal or above user dont Buy this mobile. This mobile hanging for normal social apps. Display is decent. When enabled 90HZ refresh rate. The mobile processor heats up. Sound & Battery quality is really superb. Camera is below average. Not worth for the money.
193,3.0,Good phone with poor camera,"I was using redmi note 8 before buying this phone. I was looking for a better camera. This phone has good speed and battery life but the camera is highly disappointing. Picture quality is  just like a 13 MP camera.  Redmi note 8 clicked better and sharper pics. If you a looking for a good camera phone, avoid this."
194,4.0,A good budget phone,A good allrounder budget 4G smartphone.Pros -1. Super amoled display (Full HD)2. Stereo Sound (Pretty loud)3. Quick charger support4. Light weight (Matte finish is awesome feels good while holding smartphone)5. Decent ProcessorCons -1. Does not support always on display even though it has amoled display.
195,1.0,Lagging after 2 weeks of usage.,"The device started  to lag after 2 weeks of usage. People might say its because of the apps installed but guess was, it is used by an older person who only uses whatsapp facebook and some basic apps.Dont buy it if you are planning to replace your old slow phone."
196,3.0,Basically the UI of this phone sucks.. No useful gestures for volume control or screenshot.,Ok. The phone looks pretty cool and battery is amazingly stands for a full day 9 to 9 which is really great. Camera quality is also fine with good amount of day light. But basically the UI of this phone sucks. It's getting unlock automatically. While speaking a call it attempts to go on mute with out touching it and unlocks automatically sometime when I put it in my pocket. Notifications slides not wrks properly. Lot of issues are there in UI itself. But if you can consider it. It's a nice pick for daily use.
197,4.0,A Snapdragon that doesn't breathe fire,"Came to know different versions in market. Mine has few features hidden like second space; dual apps,etc.Still not updated. Glitches, reboots, freezes, observed way more than my old POCO M2, but is snappier otherwise"
198,4.0,"Good display, big battery, light weight","After 2 weeks of use here goes the review. The product has a smooth screen battery lasts long or depends on use but for general daily use its a big battery. The snapdragon works well for the device. Doesn't feel heavy for the pocket as its the light weight and slim too . The Only and important thing to notice is the camera quality, its not upto the mark of Xiaomi note series."
199,1.0,Worst Phone Ever,I received the phone on froday i opened it saturday and only whatsapp and candy crush and you lnow what happened a 4+1Gb ram phone not able to play candy crush smoothly and amazon is refusing for refund. First ever Mi phone and thats too worst one. Will never fo for Mi phones and other gadgets again. And will also not buy any thing from amazon again. Mi maling customer's fool by giving wrong specs phone as this phone is not a 6nm processor phone.
200,4.0,Nice one,Best product in this price range...
201,1.0,Worst experience,"Like: only battery lifeMany dislikes: worst camera, heating issue, hangs in between, finger print is worst not useful. Please please don't buy this. Heats during charging. If you watch YouTube videos be prepare to get heating issue. Heats while talking only after 10 mins. Not recommend. I was using note 5 pro. Cannot compare to note 5 pro. Sound quality is also not good."
202,1.0,processor worst hai.. Daily task bhi sahi se perform nahi kar pa raha hai. Go for other brand,I used it from last 3-4 days.. Don't buy it.. Worst products.. Hang ho raha hai. Waste of money.  No good camera. No good enough battery backup. Gorila bola hai but display pr normal scratch aaya hai.. Processor worst hai.. Daily task bhi sahi se perform nahi kar pa raha hai. Go for other brand. I already ised redmi note 5 pro.. So that's why I was purchase it.. But vary bad experience ever. Go for oneplus samsung and other brand
203,3.0,BAD CAMERA,Display and sound Clarity is awesome but Camera performance is very very bad and Dailer application performance is very bad. If your choice is camera please dont go for this Product.Its Below to its previous version of its model. I think need to Solve this By software.
204,4.0,A good phone but not the best camera you can get.,"I like the battery the most on this phone cause I used it for a day and it didn't go under 60 even after 2 hrs of call of duty gaming. It's been a week since I got it and it charges upto 10% in 5-6 mins.But according to the quad camera 50mp setup, the picture quality is not the best on the market. Except this, no regrets after buying this."
205,5.0,Worth the price.!,"After you receive the product, make sure it doesn't have any manufacturing defects, This is second unit I have received because the first one had some manufacturing defect. I asked for an replacement and they replaced the product. Thanks for that. Product is good and worth the money!"
206,3.0,Sim ejector tool missing,"Sim ejector tool missingThis is the second instance where the sim ejector tool was missing in the box.  Have I really received a new product, not sure.Previously when I ordered a Redmi power 9, the ejector tool was missing."
207,5.0,Good phone.,"They should really work on doing away with bloatwares. If indeed they want the consumers to be aware of them, give them but please lat the user uninstall them if they don't want to use them. Do not force them down their throats."
208,3.0,Camera Quality is not good,"The camera quality is not as we expect from the Red Mi note series. The front camera is not up to the mark. the color tone is not very natural and the quality is bad. In this price range, there are more smartphones that give 4k 30fps but this phone only supports 1080p 30fps. All together the phone is very good in terms of looks, and build quality, the latest Miui 13 also runs lag-free. Only one request to Red Mi please fix the camera with updates.Thank you"
209,4.0,Battery not good,Battery does not last longer. It works for about 20 hours for a full charge. But get full charge within 1 hour of charging.I doubt whether the battery is faulty. It seams having 3000mAh capacity.
210,4.0,Efficient and handy,"This mobile is all good but the camera is not upto the mark. It has good battery life, working smoothly and fastly, very handy and light weight.... The only problem I faced after using one and half month is the camera quality... Portrait mode, night mode are okay but the normal camera should be more upgraded... But if camera quality does not come to you in the first preference... Buy it!! Ohh I forgot to appreciate the display quality... It's really nice!!! Thank you"
211,4.0,Typical Redmi,Good phone at a good price point. The square borders offer a good grip without a case. Comes with MIUI 13. Some bloatwares were there but thank heavens they could be uninstalled with rooting.
212,4.0,Camera quality is fair,"User interface is better than samsung mobiles, Google assistant is awesome, tools- notes, calculator, clock, calendar, flash light are awesome. Only the thing is camera disappointed if you zoom a photo taken by 50mp camera it doesn't show you the details means too much of noise in photos other wise this mobile is far good and what else we want in under Rs.14,000/-?!"
213,1.0,Worst phone,"The camera of the phone is very bad and the selfie does not work at all and I have made 10 more calls to them to take your phone return but that you are fooling me and making her download some application again and again and call  Refusing to return, I had given a gift to my younger sister wearing this, but now my mind is spoiled due to so much phone failure, I become sad with them"

215,5.0,Good product,First impression of the phone is:I really like the way they put one speaker at the bottom and one on the top making it stereo. The sound quality from them is good. I also like how the display looks.Haven't really tested the camera so no review on it.The phone got delivered on the same day. Ordered it in the morning and received it in the evening.The UI is very responsive though I haven't tested it on games.
216,1.0,Please don't waste your money by buying this phone!!,"This is the worst set in this price range! It's just been 3 months now, and I am regretting my decision of buying this now itself. Camera - bad, system, worse, and the entire set- worst. The phone hangs at any point of time, even without exhaustive use. It has a pathetic problem of heating, and the charging cable is not at all turbo in nature as claimed!!! Please don't waste your money. You can very easily go for sets like poco/ realme/samsung. But please don't buy this!!!!!"
217,1.0,Returned it once and still received the faulty product,"Bought this phone 20 days ago and returned it once however, having same problem with the returned product.Rebooting itselfUnable to charge or very slow chargingNow, as per the Amazon policy I need to get it repaired from MI service centre which is unacceptable for me because 20 days old phone need to repair and I have to use a repaired phone after paying price of a new phone.Please do not buy this phone."
218,1.0,Google dialer h.. don't buy,"6gb ram.. not at all. Most worst thing in this phone is it has google dialer, in which call recording announcement and slow working. And you not allow to disable this. And other all call recording app not working. Its true. Check on YouTube"

Amoled display is also good and bright.It is a good phone for normal usage.I am happy with the mobile.
225,3.0,Go for 4/64 rather than 6/128,"I received defective product, two times in a row,May be it's the faulty product, because I had the same issues both timesHere's the problem i faced,1. As u can see in image, charging from 0-90 took me 3+ hrs.2. Blur selfie photo3. Camera doesn't feel like 50 MP4. Performance not as i expectedBetter go for 4/64 varient because it has no issues, my friend has it and i have confirmed it myself"

Some used phone may be handovered to me , with in two days issue with display.posted a video also ,"
229,4.0,Good phone for multimedia streaming and average gaming,"The phone is good for multimedia streaming such as YouTube, Facebook, WhatsApp etc. The AMOLED display quality and the dual speakers are good. Camera is very average. If you are choosing this for camera, better go for other models. Even though this phone have 6nm processor, you can slightly feel the heating during games and high tasks. Hardware side is good but the software side has several bugs. Overall, this phone is for average users."
230,4.0,Not that happy with Redmi Note 11,"Redmi Note 11 has amazing display quality. Really loved it. Also the sound quality is very good. I've used this phone for almost 24 hrs after charging for the first time and 21% charge is left with moderate usage. The front camera of Redmi Note 11 is quite bad, also the macro lense isn't upto the mark. 50 mp lense and the wide lense aren‚Äôt that good. I thought the picture quality would be great, but in reality it isn't. I hope Xiaomi gives any software update to fix this."
231,1.0,Overall bad choice,Pathetic camera quality . One who is looking for camera option please don't consider this as an option . There is no return with money back option so think 10 times before choosing this phone . Phone hangs while downloading any application .
232,3.0,The troublesome UI,The ui has become more troublesome and the calling and messaging is hectic the gernal miui was far better and simple while the system occupies almost 20gb of internal storage i got only 45 gb of storage in the 64gb variant and the ram fusion is only 1 gb in this variant which is not highlighted in specs
233,3.0,Not fit for DUAL APPS,"Some times phone hangs, dual apps not working properly ,even after giving permission for camera and speaker u can't talk on WhatsApp call or can't send voice messages, more over it gives information to other person when call is being recorded"

235,1.0,Misleading and fraudulent specs,Camera quality is bad can't tell any difference between it and 13MP realme c3 camera quality (and yes i even tried forced 50MP option). Battery life is not upto the mark. And finally the processor is definitely not 6nm 2.4ghz that would play games like asphalt legend butter smooth but it lags a lot. Phone is light weight for such hefty specs portraying it's quality issues.

239,1.0,Absolutely terrible,"You are reading this review from a person who has been a redmi customer for almost 7 years, this has to be one of the worst product I have ever bought, even with 6gb ram the mobile just freeze constantly, apps needs to be cleared wifi is very poor, battery quality is not up to the mark the only thing good about this mobile is it's screen, and lastly the camera uffff I can't describe how pathetic the camera is."
240,4.0,Good phone on this budget,"Looks very good of this phone, good processor, enough battery life. But camera quality is not so good as 50 megapixl. But it is ok as it's price & brand. Screen resolution is very good."
241,1.0,Don't buy it,"Performance is much worst, even redmi note 10s is far better over this phone. Apps won't open in a second it takes 3 to 4 seconds to open and show contents inside the app (both online and offline apps) .What to say about my experience i have exchanged my note 10s to buy this lagger phone. Now I'm counting numbers when the phone is trying and struggling to load basic applications."
242,3.0,Worst Camera and Video quality,This mobile is not for camera enthusiastic people. Picture quality is worsy among redmi series phone. Video quality also experiences frame drop and no eis. Very shaky video. Max is 1080 30fps. Rather my note 7 pro has good photo and video quality. I regret buying this mobile. Except camera other things are good.
243,4.0,Worse than previous generation but acceptable at lower price,"Got it with a discounted price. Camera is worse, have charging issues after MIUI 13 but I think those will be fixed.Other than that, it's quite sturdy device with acceptable performance at this price point."

247,4.0,Except camera quality everything is best.,"Features that mentioned by redmi are fantastic to use.lightweight,beautiful display,body colure stardust blue looks very attractive.But camera quality is very bad in indoors or low light.looks like very cheaper phone while consider to camera quality.But in outdoor camera works properly.gives fantastic camera quality."

2798,1.0,This is the worst phone I have ever used.,"Yes, when I say worst phone ever used I am not talking about this gen phone Or the phones I have used. This is worst of all I have ever used.Pros:Battery is okCons:Continuous hangs even when using a single app like chrome, and other apps are worse when used on this phone.Camera is basically works more like VGA with hazy images and broken pixels when zoomed. I am not bad at photography so that stays out of question.Display looks bad and artificial, color combination is unreal.You will mostly feel frustrated as this phone keeps hanging on phone calls while using the phone, when switching between apps.And worst of all, if you switch between windows it basically loose all works on minimized windows, so get issues while upi payments.I remember posting a review earlier as well but Amazon did not post it. So I am recording this post and will move to Twitter if this does not get posted as there is no bad word used in this review nor was used in earlier one."
2799,2.0,Average phone not worth of buying in 12k,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Camera is not upto the mark.Size of phone is also average,Overall we can get better phone in this range.I think RedmiCamera is not upto the mark.Size of phone is also average,Overall we can get better phone in this range.I think Redmi 11 price should be 9-10k not more than that,Video recording quality is also poor.Only Battery life is good.I'm using Redmi note 9 , which is far better than this.Surely, I'll not purchase any product from REDMI, as now they just wants to make more profit and NOT providing the quality."
2800,5.0,I've been rated 5 out of 5 because it deserves check out my full review,"Redmi Note 11 Is a Fantastic phone I've ever seen.. In this price range... I'm not going to compare it with any Samsung device as because Samsung is different.I'm going to share my Honest Experience as a MIUI User...I'm using the 6 Gigabyte of Ram and 64 Gigabyte of storage Version of Redmi Note 11Now I'm going to share out my Honest Experience about the phone from Design to Performance. In point 1 to 71. Design - Xiaomi is been inspired with Apple I phone as Apple Made their box shape phone. Xiaomi had done a well done job in the design part ... It looks awesome when you hold the device. And When you've the starbrust white shade.2.Display - Suprisely this phone comes with 90 hz of refresh rate with Full hd + Amoled panel no doubt it's an awesome display.To be honest with you guy's I'm a IPS LCD panel user After switch it to Amoled I've seen a huge difference.  I mean I'm enjoying with Amoled display.3. Battery - This Phone comes with 5000 Mah of Lithium polymer battery ( non removable)The Back-up of Battery is awesome  This Phone can easily handle 1 and a half day easily if your a decent as me is a decent user who only use only normal casual application which is needed in our daily lives without which we can't servive Yes I'm talking about Google, Google Chrome, YouTube, Wekipedia , WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc ....4. Power adapter - So Guy's I've been checked the charging of this phone I've seen a mind blowing results like if you are going to put your phone on Charge from 0 to 100% it will take around 1.5 hours ... If your going to change from 50 to 100 % so it will roughly take 30 to 45 minutes according to your room temperature ..5. Performance - So if I talked about the performance of this phone I've not seen any lags and anything that affect my user experience . It's a smooth phone as on this budget . It also comes with 6nm technology it makes the phone fast I will not say super fast but yeah it's fast..6. Camera - This phone work's well when it comes to Camera segment. To be honest I'm not a photo addict but still the Photo blow my mind..Last point 7. MIUI 13 :- This is the First Xiaomi's smart phone which comes with MIUI 13 out of the box .I've heard from so many people says that MIUI is based on adds and MIUI worst and etc but trust me guy's I'm using Miui for last 5 years from MIUI 8 to 13 I've a wonderful journey with MIUI .MIUI 8 is super laggy I remember on that Time but Xiaomi Fix so many bugs in MIUI 9 .Xiaomi say's that they Had fix so many bugs in MIUI 13 . I've a answer for this statement - yes they had fix so many bugs which Are been present in MIUI 12 ..So guy's I think I won't able to stop myself for being appreciate about this phone...Conclusion.Yes you can Go for this product if your coming from any other ecosystem like Samsung for example you will be not dissatisfied while using MIUI...So my advice is for those who want a smooth phone under 14k please go for this phone I promise it will blow your mind ..."
2801,1.0,Pathetic camera. Good battery,"Biggest negative why you shouldn't buy this phone is:1. Back camera is not upto the mark.2. Front camera is even worst.Fast charging is good otherwise.Should be for less than 10k.Verdict: Pay 2k more and buy Samsung F23.Reasons: 5G phone, better cameras in samsung, better SD processor, low radiation level. More storage in low end variant."
2802,3.0,Go for redmi note 10 pro instead,"Redmi note 10 pro is better value for money. let me tell you why:1. Note 10 has better Camera compared to Note 11.  a. 64MP vs 50 MP. 0.70 ¬µm vs 0.64 ¬µm. bigger the size better the quality  b. Wide Angle lens Sensor - Sony IMX355 vs GalaxyCore GC08A3  c. Macro lens - 5 Mpx vs 2 Mpx  d. Front camera - 16 Mpx Sony IMX471 Exmor RS vs 13 Mpx Samsung S5K3L62. Better Screen - Refresh rate 120 Hz vs 90 Hz3. Slow Motion Video - 960 fps vs 120 fps4. Build - Glass back vs Plastic back5. SOC - SD 732 vs SD 680 (antutu score 3,36,250 vs 248.639)More important thing - Both are placed at same price @ when i am writing this review (2022 summer sale) for 6gb RAM and 128gb storage variant. Actually Note 10 pro is bit cheaper than Note 11 ."
2803,4.0,Overall Satisfied,"Hi folks. So I bought this phone last week. Snd overall I am satisfied. It's not one of those premium smart phone but it's not a cheap range product as well. I am not a gamer or have heavy usage, so about processor and battery, works great for me. This has a fingerprint reader in the unlock button itself, works very efficiently. Build quality is also good enough. If you know how to customize your themes, this will look far far superior. About camera, I have added few photos, and I feel it is good for landscape and natural photography but maybe not so much for portrays. But you can give it a try. And lastly, I am not at all a selfie person, but if you are then you may have slight disappointment with front camera. That is something where Xiaomi has made blunder.Overall, mobile preferences are all person to person varying. Depending on your normal usage, you can go fir this. Oh btw, this costed me 14,000/- with bank discounts.Cheers ."
2804,4.0,Very good display n battery but pathetic camera,"Buy this phone for superb amoled display. Very loud and clear stereo speakers, Fantastic charge speed and 1.5 days battery. Factory applied screen guard.On downside the camera is really bad (resolution install Gcam), the processor is kind of slow. Even SD665 processor is faster than this one. Overall performance is about 1sec slower compared to redmi note 8. Definitely not for gaming. RAM booster is useless. Hope this helps"
2805,3.0,It's just Meh,"Bought a new phone after a long long time. Previously had the Redmi note 5 and it worked like a charm until the last moment. I feel bad for dropping it from my hand. So I thought I'd go for this one. Had a few good expectations. I'm not a techie or anything, so I will just talk about a few things I did not like.1) I absolutely do not like the fingerprint reader. Its so small, and almost always have to touch it twice for the phone to unlock .2) The auto brightness feature suuuuucks. It's either too bright or too dim. Never gets it to the right setting.3) I thought the battery life should last long, but I honestly don't find it to be so. I am someone who does not have a lot of apps on my phone. And dont use it much. I keep mobile data off. Its just on wifi. But still, lasts for a day tops.4) Something about the speaker of this phone is off. I cannot hear it properly at certain angles.These are my 2 cents. Purchase with caution. You wont be missing out on a lot."
2806,4.0,Good for Basic Usage,"It's quite good phone for basic usage. The Display is way too good and 90Hz feels so smooth. Speakers are lound enough, so multimedia experience is best.The device is quite handy and light weighted, also you can use it with single hand.Battery life is too good, the 6nm chipset and 5000mAh makes the battery life lasts for 1-1.5days long. You can charge it in less than 1 hours. (I only charge 20-90%).If you want to play games, please consider another device. Also if your priority is camera, don't go for this one."
2807,5.0,First mobile in budget that took my heart üíñ,"Screen Quality is amazing, Very bright in direct sunlight.Camera is descent according to price (not great).battery back up is good.charging speed is also good.Processor is very good for normal users ( Not for gamers ).Overall a very very good mobile for normal users who want a good phone for daily use."
2808,3.0,Below Avg,"Got this phone on the first sale for 13k and today just after 40 days its price is below 11 k , I lost 2.5 k , Camera is horrible. This mobile is not worth 13 k , price should b around 10 k considering the processor n no 5g"
2809,1.0,"Totally waste of money don't buy this phone camera quality is wrost than wrost ,performance low","Honest review :I have ordered this phone from another account but trust me my review is honest1. camera quality is more than wrost beacsue they give 50mp but that can't take photos even 5mp2. heating problem when charging and gaming3. fingerprint  once don't work quickly4. I think processor they must give more better than this in this price range 13.5 k they given sd680 but in this range it deserve more better performance like they should give the sd7 or mediatek Helio 90 or 96Con Expect there 4 mejor issues other all qualities are goodBest in Phone4g +4g is good network , 1 gb ram extended 4+1 is good , fast charging is also goodI have disappointed from this product and returned this phone made in india but (  parts are Chinese only so I call this phone China phone only ) so it's better to go for non Chinese brands Thank you"
2810,5.0,Nearly perfect,Its a value for money product -Highlights -Design ( Subjective ) and the Display is just amazing . Perfect for people using it for media consumption and social media . Battery and charging.Average - Camera Primary sensor is good (in good lightings) rest other cameras are good to have at times if you need increases reachability.Need improvement -RAM management not recommended to those who do multitasking.But for the price i think of the best options definitely worth considering.
2811,1.0,Worst phone ever,"Do not buy this phone.. It has lagging problem.. It hangs a lot, it heats and the most worst is redmi service centre.. They just waste your time that's it.. I have bought this phone 2 days ago and despite having so much problems they are not replacing my phone.. Pls don't buy this"
2812,4.0,Dont expect more on camera clarity! Others are okay!,Pros:Battery life - (Normal usage i get 2 days)Performance - i am not a gamer so i cudn't found any lag in day-to-day usage.Display - Amoled with 90HzAudio - Stereo speakersCons:camera quality - not upto mark in this price range
2813,2.0,Redmi Note 11 has bad quality in terms of camera and battery,"The Redmi Note series phone has lost the quality.- Camera: Very bad, images in low light are so bad as if it is taken from a very cheap quality camera phone.- Battery: Ok, neither good nor bad, but charging is extremely slow despite being a 33 W charger.- Performance: We can't expect much, but phone gets heated even after playing a low end game for few minutes.I would suggest to spare few extra bucks and look for better phones or go for any other phone in same budget, but please don't buy Redmi Note 11 else you will repent later."

2818,1.0,Must say the real truth.,"Camera is below average, note 10 has 60fps supports and new generation doesn't have 60fps, why would you degrade you products. Front camera is like 2 mega pixel in old nokia phone. Next phone is surely not gonna be mi, Mi sold a lot of phones in inda and now they only care about business not customers. Who ever sees this comment please buy some other phone. I bought 6-128gb for 16k, hard earn money wasted."

3032,2.0,Don't waste your money to buy Note 11,"I used this phone for just two days, then I sold it. I never saw the worst product from the Mi brand. Except the display quality and loud sound everything is the worst, especially both camera, and processor. In daylight the camera captured dark images. Ultra wide and macro modes really sucks. After I took the shoot it felt like a 10 mp camera picture quality. Selfies are becoming worse and worse. In good lighting conditions at night the camera takes the grainy images.Sound quality is very loud even if you talk to person with earpiece , someone who is in front of you he or she can easily hear what you talked.So please stay away from this phone.Don't buy it.Don't waste your hard earned money for this device. I already took a loss so I want you don't waste your money."
3033,1.0,Software malfunction intentionally added to mimic hardware malfunction,Don't buy Xiaomi phones. They add software malfunctions that mimics hardware malfunction so that u go to Xiaomi service centre. After 1.5 years of usage they added volume slider malfunction bug but after sometime it got fixed on its own. Then they added slow charging malfunction. They want me to buy a new phone n m waiting for this malfunction to be fixed
